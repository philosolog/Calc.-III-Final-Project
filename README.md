# What's this?
This repository is a compilation of resources designed for my multivariable calculus class' final project: a research† experience where students must design a lesson plan on a math topic and present it to the class.

To complete the assignment, students may form groups to:
- self-study a topic in mathematics,
- produce a written document exploring the topic,
- and develop a presentation for the class.

My team ([Brennan](https://github.com/Brensum), [Jordan](https://github.com/Jadams06), [Kerem](https://github.com/Ottoerm7), [Oliver](https://github.com/aureliusandreas)) and I decided to dive into the mechanics and applications of Lagrangian functions and Lagrange multipliers. I decided to use GitHub for the version control & device syncing of our work as we compile our assets.

† By "research," we refer to the self-education used to assist us in creating a presentation for our class- in no way do we intend to publish a math paper.

# Usage
To compile the slides:
```console
manim-slides convert Example_1_1 Example_1_2 main.html -ccontrols=true --use-template template.html
```
