# What's this?
 
This repository serves to organize the resources that my classmates and I procured toward the completion of our calculus III class's final project: a research† experience where we produce a report and presentation.

We decided to study the methods and applications surrounding Lagrangian functions and Lagrange Multipliers.

† By "research," we refer to the self-education used to create a presentation for our class- in no way are we officially contributing to the writing of proper math papers.
