# What's this?
A **compilation of resources** for my multivariable calculus class' final project: *a research† experience where students must design a lesson plan on a math topic and present it to the class*.

To complete the assignment, students may form groups to:
- self-study a topic in mathematics,
- produce a written document exploring the topic,
- and develop a presentation for the class.

My team ([Brennan](https://github.com/Brensum), [Jordan](https://github.com/Jadams06), [Kerem](https://github.com/Ottoerm7), [Oliver](https://github.com/aureliusandreas)) and I decided to dive into the mechanics and applications of Lagrangian functions and Lagrange multipliers. I decided to use GitHub for its repository version control & device syncing.

**† By "research," we refer to the self-education used to assist us in creating a presentation for our class- in no way do we intend to publish a math paper.**

# Usage
## Paper
Check out our LaTeX-compiled completed paper assignment [here](https://github.com/philosolog/Exploring-Lagrangian-Optimization/blob/main/Paper/Wrapper.pdf)! 
## Presentation
Run this in a console to compile the slides locally:
```console
manim-slides convert Introduction Lagrange_Multipliers Key_Differences Cobb_Douglas_Introduction Cobb_Douglas_Problem Physics_Problem main.html -ccontrols=true --use-template template.html
```
Or, visit this [Pages site](https://philosolog.github.io/Exploring-Lagrangian-Optimization-Slides/) (it might not be synced.. but it should be).
