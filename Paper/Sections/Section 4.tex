\chapter{Carl's Parlor}
After Joe decided to buy everything from Carl's Parlor, Carl-Friedrich decided to not accept anymore customers until the icecream and chicken dispensers were refilled.
Also, Carl was the only worker at his icecream shop, so he is interested in hiring more workers.

To financially plan these business plans, Carl viewed a couple YouTube videos on the \textbf{Cobb-Douglas production function}.
\begin{remark}
	The Cobb-Douglas production function is an economics concept that relates a firm's production output $Y$ in terms of two inputs, labor $(L)$ and capital $(K)$.

	The production function can be written as:
	\[Y(L, K) = AL^{\alpha}K^{1 - \alpha}\]
	Where..
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A is a constant for \textit{$^\ddag$total-factor productivity},
		\item $\alpha$ is the output elasticities of either capital
	\end{itemize}
\end{remark}
If there are any constraints on the variables $L$ and $K$, like a budget, then the method of Lagrange multipliers can be utilized to find the specific quantities of capital and labor that maximizes output $Y(L, K)$ for constraint functions.

In this question, Carl's
