Delightful! Joe greatly enjoyed the addition of meat- the piquant umami was a new experience for his buds.

Despite already heightening his satisfaction twice, Joe was yet again deciding on another combination of a meat-topped ice cream.
This time, his only constraint is that he wants the umami flavor to be inversely proportional to half the sweetness felt.
\begin{eg} % TODO: Linked ref.
	Given that his satisfaction can again be represented by eq. (3.1), Joe desires for a nonnegative amount of each flavor and wants to try a combination where the flavor of umami he attains is inversely proportional to half the sweetness.

	With what combination of $(u, s)$ can Joe attain his maximum satisfaction?

Now, for what this project was all about, let's apply Joe's strategy to a generalized example.
\begin{eg}
	Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the maximum of $2x-y$ given the following constraint:
	\begin{center}
		$3x^2-4xy+2y^2=6$
	\end{center}
	Also, find the point $(x, y)$ where said maximum is achieved.
\end{eg}
