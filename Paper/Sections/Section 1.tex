\begin{theorem}[$\dagger$ The Extreme Value Theorem in $\mathbb{R}^2$]
	Suppose that \(f\left( x \right)\) is continuous on the interval \(\left[ {a,b} \right]\) then there are two numbers \(a \le c,d \le b\) so that \(f\left( c \right)\) is an absolute maximum for the function and \(f\left( d \right)\) is an absolute minimum for the function.
\end{theorem}
